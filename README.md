Whenever he wants to get insights of thses region he would call these people and on the phone regional manager give some insights to him that this was the sales last quarter and we are going to grow by this much in the next quarter.

## Data Analysis using MySQL:-
1. Import file [db_dump.sql](https://github.com/Gunjan8/Sales_Insight_AtliQ_hardware/blob/main/db_dump.sql)  and [db_dump_2](https://github.com/Gunjan8/Sales_Insight_AtliQ_hardware/blob/main/db_dump_version_2%20(1).sql) in MySQL.
2. Analysis of data in MySQl by running several queries like I have done in this file [Sales_Insight](https://github.com/Gunjan8/Sales_Insight_AtliQ_hardware/blob/main/SalesInsight.sql) .

## Tableau [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gunjan.chandak/viz/Sales_Insight_AtliQ_hardware/Dashboard-Profitanalysis):-
1. Connect the MySQL database with the Tableau desktop.
2. Organize  databse in star schema data model so it is easy to understand and analyze. ![Alt text](https://github.com/Gunjan8/Sales_Insight_AtliQ_hardware/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(26).png)
3. Filter the negative and 0 values in sales amount column in transaction table by giving the column range above 0.
4. Convert USD into INR in the transactionâ€™s table because the AtliQ Hardware only works in India so the USD values are not required. To convert those USD values use calculated field option to create a column Normalized amount and write a formula to rectify this issue. `IF [Currency] =='USD' THEN [Sales Amount]*74 ELSE [Sales Amount] END`
5. Make individual sheets to visualize and analyse data and then compile them to make dashboard .
6.
